# Project Overview
## Context
The owner of a supermarket mall through membership cards,  have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. The owner wants to understand the customers like who are the target customers so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

The owner of the mall have asked us to use data, and Machine Learning to help segment up their customers to aid in understanding of the customer base, and to enhance the relevancy of targeted messaging & customer communications.

## Actions
 We need to apply some data pre-processing, that is importing the relevant libraries, importing the data, and making sure that it is clean. The elbow method is then used to help determine the optimal number of clusters as the K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning approach.
Based upon iterative testing using Within Cluster Sum of Squares(WCSS) and the elbow method, a customer segmentation with 4 clusters was settled on. The data was then trained on this number of clusters to determine how customers are segmented.
